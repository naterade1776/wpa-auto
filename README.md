# wpa-auto
Use this script to easily configure a WiFi connection on a headless Linux device. 

Dependencies:

- wpa_supplicant


This script assumes that your wpa_supplicant config files are in the /etc/wpa_supplicant directory. If not, it will maybe probably still work.

To use, clone to preferred directory (other than /etc), run as root, and answer the prompts. You can also run the script multiple times, follow the prompts, and
	create multiple profiles.
